### Requirements

- you need to install the packages `factorcopula` and `cheopsr`, which are only available on github
- to create the original facebook dataset you need a simple text file with the name `URI` containing the database logins 
- to rerun the facebook analysis you need to run the script `facebook_create.R` first. This creates `posts.rds` dataset in the `data` folder
